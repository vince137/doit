## DOIT!

DoIT! is a todo list that allows you to organize and manage your tasks in team. The app is written in Angular2.

## Informations
DoIT is using Angular2 rc4 for the front. I have designed it to work on a apache webserver but you can run it on the server of your choice. 
Don't forget to redirect all the request to the "/" on your server config.
For the Back, doIT is using nodeJS with express server. Data are stored in a Mongo database.

## Project Status
The project is in progress at this moment. I push all the new functionnality in the dev branch.
